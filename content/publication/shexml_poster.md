abstract = "Data interoperability is currently a problem that we are facing more intensely due to the appearance of fields like Big Data or IoT. Many data is persisted in information silos with neither interconnection nor format homogenisation. Our proposal to alleviate this problem is ShExML, a language based on ShEx that can map and merge heterogeneous data formats into a single RDF representation. We advocate the creation of this type of tools that can facilitate the migration of nonsemantic data to the Semantic Web."
