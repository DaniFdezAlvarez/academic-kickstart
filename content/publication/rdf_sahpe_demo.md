abstract = "The quality of RDF based solutions requires the possibilityto  describe  and  validate  RDF  graphs.  In  the  recent  years,  two  tech-nologies  have  been  proposed  for  RDF  validation:  ShEx  and  SHACL.RDFShape is a web service that can be used as an RDF playground tovalidate RDF with those technologies, but can also be used as a generalRDF  playground  allowing  to  parse,  convert,  visualize  and  query  RDFdata.  The  validation  engine  supports  both  ShEx  and  SHACL,  allowsthe  conversion  between  different  schema  formats,  and  is  able  visualizeschemas using UML-like class diagrams. The system offers the possibil-ity to play with different RDF technologies in a unified setting and hasalready been used to teach RDF technologies in several courses and tuto-rials. It has also been employed in industrial RDF workflows that neededa web service for RDF data validation and management."
